# Hyper List

A simple hyperapp-powered list

## Purpose

Creates a minimal working todo-style list to demonstrate a minimum working hyperapp.

This is one of my favourite basic apps because there are a lot of interesting upgrades we can demonstrate, like saving (via localstorage or third-party database), live collaboration (via websockets), live validation, lifecycle hooks, etc.
I'll be using this repo to create many forks to demonstrate these various upgrades and step you, the reader, through those upgrades.

## Getting started

Install everything:

```
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Get it running:

```
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

[localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
