# Hyper List

A simple hyperapp-powered list

## Purpose

Creates a minimal working todo-style list to demonstrate a minimum working hyperapp.

This is one of my favourite basic apps because there are a lot of interesting upgrades we can demonstrate, like saving (via localstorage [1](https://github.com/LearnHyperapp/hyper-list/tree/local-storage-save-load) [2](https://github.com/LearnHyperapp/hyper-list/tree/local-storage-auto-save-load) or third-party database), live collaboration (via websockets), [live validation](https://github.com/LearnHyperapp/hyper-list/tree/use-forms-gud), lifecycle hooks, etc.
I'll be using this repo to create many forks to demonstrate these various upgrades and step you, the reader, through those upgrades.

## Getting started

Install everything:

```
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Get it running:

```
npm start
# or
